the number of subjects required for the study should be justified the number of subjects should always be large enough to provide a reliable answer to questions addressed also the size of detectable differences should be of clinical relevancethe number of subjects is usually determined by the primary objective of the trial if the sample size is determined on some other basis then this should be made clear and justified there are many formulas to calculate the size of the study population it should be clear which method is used and the reasons why this method has been chosen in case of multiple primary objectives eg evaluation of multiple endpoints each objective should have its own power calculation and in each of these the multiplicity corrected alpha if needed should be taken into accountalso the calculation itself should be given with a predefined p-value (usually 5) and power the power of the study is the probability that the study will have a significant (positive) result  provided a positive effect exists ask advice from a statistician to help you with this matter,1

overarching comment on “read-across approach” to support the risk profile for pfhxs it is suggested that the risk profile would be strengthened by including the approach that has been adopted on how and when data on analogous substances are to be used  data from analogous substances are cited notably from pfos and pfbs   in the absence of an approach the readers are invited to apply their own interpretation which may vary creating debate as to the relevance and applicability of the read across information presented  for instance in paragraph 86 it is stated that available studies comparing toxic effects of pfbs and pfos in aquatic organisms indicate that toxicity increases with increasing carbon chain length   (giesy et al 2010)  assuming this is the basis of utilizing read across information it may be worthwhile to state this assumption within the context of utilizing read across  on the other hand data cited in paragraph 86 from lou et al 2013 indicate effects were observed resulting from pfos exposure while no effects were observed from pfbs exposure  in paragraph 96 effects were noted by corsini et al 2012 in exposures to both pfos and pfbs  these two examples may help establish a framework to explain the use of read across information  where effects exists for both pfos and pfbs which can be viewed as boundary substances to pfhxs in terms of carbon chain length it may be reasonable to infer that a similar effect is elicited by pfhxs although assigning a median effect concentration may be challenging  other considerations can also include a statement when appropriate where a read across approach is even more limitative such as for ecotoxicity data due to sparse toxixity results and the species- gender- and chain length-dependency   furthermore in the absence of having results for both pfos and pfbs there is an absence of support for asserting that a similar effect would be elicited by pfhxs  in the examples provided earlier lou et al observe an effect from pfos exposure but none for pfbs  consequently assigning similar behavior to pfhxs is difficult to support  use of read across information by interpolating between similar substances is a useful and legitimate technique in risk assessment particularly when dealing with relatively data poor substances  by articulating a framework as to when and how read across information is used and citing data that falls within this framework would strengthen the risk profile for pfhxs,0

account for all bid alternates and arrange in order of priority for awarding of contractwhere there is a maximum limit on the amount of budget dollars available for the project and the city has chosen to utilize the alternate bid process to maximize the benefits of the limited funds available for the contract the alternate bid process must be clearly described  the city cannot use the alternate bid process whereby the city may randomly choose from among different bid alternates thus giving the impression of improprietyin general the concept allows for contractors to bid on a basic scope of work for the project and also on alternate work items which fall outside of the basic scope of work  these alternate work items can be either additions to or deletions from the basic scope of work or both  if the city receives bids on the basic scope which are less than the maximum budget dollars available add alternates will be considered for award according to a predetermined order of priority so long as the final total bid price remains under the maximum budget dollars available  conversely if all bids received by the city exceed the maximum budget dollars available deduct alternates will be considered for award to stay within budgetin order to assure bidders of the integrity of the competitive bid process the criteria and formula for determining the low bidder in an alternate bid process must be fully and clearly described in the contract documents  the bid solicitation must advise potential bidders that alternate bidding will be used  whether using add or deduct alternates the city must prioritize the bid alternates following a rational sequence that must be adhered to when awarding the contract,0

overarching comment on “read-across approach” to support the risk profile for pfhxs it is suggested that the risk profile would be strengthened by including the approach that has been adopted on how and when data on analogous substances are to be used  data from analogous substances are cited notably from pfos and pfbs   in the absence of an approach the readers are invited to apply their own interpretation which may vary creating debate as to the relevance and applicability of the read across information presented  for instance in paragraph 86 it is stated that available studies comparing toxic effects of pfbs and pfos in aquatic organisms indicate that toxicity increases with increasing carbon chain length   (giesy et al 2010)  assuming this is the basis of utilizing read across information it may be worthwhile to state this assumption within the context of utilizing read across  on the other hand data cited in paragraph 86 from lou et al 2013 indicate effects were observed resulting from pfos exposure while no effects were observed from pfbs exposure  in paragraph 96 effects were noted by corsini et al 2012 in exposures to both pfos and pfbs  these two examples may help establish a framework to explain the use of read across information  where effects exists for both pfos and pfbs which can be viewed as boundary substances to pfhxs in terms of carbon chain length it may be reasonable to infer that a similar effect is elicited by pfhxs although assigning a median effect concentration may be challenging  other considerations can also include a statement when appropriate where a read across approach is even more limitative such as for ecotoxicity data due to sparse toxixity results and the species- gender- and chain length-dependency   furthermore in the absence of having results for both pfos and pfbs there is an absence of support for asserting that a similar effect would be elicited by pfhxs  in the examples provided earlier lou et al observe an effect from pfos exposure but none for pfbs  consequently assigning similar behavior to pfhxs is difficult to support  use of read across information by interpolating between similar substances is a useful and legitimate technique in risk assessment particularly when dealing with relatively data poor substances  by articulating a framework as to when and how read across information is used and citing data that falls within this framework would strengthen the risk profile for pfhxs,0

note to drafters many contracts have an esclation factor set to the cpi-u for either the initial term or for renewal terms best practice is to fix the rates for each term but in some circumstances this is the best way to account for growth if this is used make sure that you are specific which cpi-u you are using (eg for the whole us for the denver-boulder-greeley area etc…) because sometimes the change in cpi for those different areas can vary significantly for the same year also the cpi is an indexed number and so any price modification should be clear that it is equal to the “annual percent change in the cpi-u” and not written as being equal to the cpi-u,0

overarching comment on “read-across approach” to support the risk profile for pfhxs it is suggested that the risk profile would be strengthened by including the approach that has been adopted on how and when data on analogous substances are to be used  data from analogous substances are cited notably from pfos and pfbs   in the absence of an approach the readers are invited to apply their own interpretation which may vary creating debate as to the relevance and applicability of the read across information presented  for instance in paragraph 86 it is stated that available studies comparing toxic effects of pfbs and pfos in aquatic organisms indicate that toxicity increases with increasing carbon chain length   (giesy et al 2010)  assuming this is the basis of utilizing read across information it may be worthwhile to state this assumption within the context of utilizing read across  on the other hand data cited in paragraph 86 from lou et al 2013 indicate effects were observed resulting from pfos exposure while no effects were observed from pfbs exposure  in paragraph 96 effects were noted by corsini et al 2012 in exposures to both pfos and pfbs  these two examples may help establish a framework to explain the use of read across information  where effects exists for both pfos and pfbs which can be viewed as boundary substances to pfhxs in terms of carbon chain length it may be reasonable to infer that a similar effect is elicited by pfhxs although assigning a median effect concentration may be challenging  other considerations can also include a statement when appropriate where a read across approach is even more limitative such as for ecotoxicity data due to sparse toxixity results and the species- gender- and chain length-dependency   furthermore in the absence of having results for both pfos and pfbs there is an absence of support for asserting that a similar effect would be elicited by pfhxs  in the examples provided earlier lou et al observe an effect from pfos exposure but none for pfbs  consequently assigning similar behavior to pfhxs is difficult to support  use of read across information by interpolating between similar substances is a useful and legitimate technique in risk assessment particularly when dealing with relatively data poor substances  by articulating a framework as to when and how read across information is used and citing data that falls within this framework would strengthen the risk profile for pfhxs,0

overarching comment on “read-across approach” to support the risk profile for pfhxs it is suggested that the risk profile would be strengthened by including the approach that has been adopted on how and when data on analogous substances are to be used  data from analogous substances are cited notably from pfos and pfbs   in the absence of an approach the readers are invited to apply their own interpretation which may vary creating debate as to the relevance and applicability of the read across information presented  for instance in paragraph 86 it is stated that available studies comparing toxic effects of pfbs and pfos in aquatic organisms indicate that toxicity increases with increasing carbon chain length   (giesy et al 2010)  assuming this is the basis of utilizing read across information it may be worthwhile to state this assumption within the context of utilizing read across  on the other hand data cited in paragraph 86 from lou et al 2013 indicate effects were observed resulting from pfos exposure while no effects were observed from pfbs exposure  in paragraph 96 effects were noted by corsini et al 2012 in exposures to both pfos and pfbs  these two examples may help establish a framework to explain the use of read across information  where effects exists for both pfos and pfbs which can be viewed as boundary substances to pfhxs in terms of carbon chain length it may be reasonable to infer that a similar effect is elicited by pfhxs although assigning a median effect concentration may be challenging  other considerations can also include a statement when appropriate where a read across approach is even more limitative such as for ecotoxicity data due to sparse toxixity results and the species- gender- and chain length-dependency   furthermore in the absence of having results for both pfos and pfbs there is an absence of support for asserting that a similar effect would be elicited by pfhxs  in the examples provided earlier lou et al observe an effect from pfos exposure but none for pfbs  consequently assigning similar behavior to pfhxs is difficult to support  use of read across information by interpolating between similar substances is a useful and legitimate technique in risk assessment particularly when dealing with relatively data poor substances  by articulating a framework as to when and how read across information is used and citing data that falls within this framework would strengthen the risk profile for pfhxs,0

overarching comment on “read-across approach” to support the risk profile for pfhxs it is suggested that the risk profile would be strengthened by including the approach that has been adopted on how and when data on analogous substances are to be used  data from analogous substances are cited notably from pfos and pfbs   in the absence of an approach the readers are invited to apply their own interpretation which may vary creating debate as to the relevance and applicability of the read across information presented  for instance in paragraph 86 it is stated that available studies comparing toxic effects of pfbs and pfos in aquatic organisms indicate that toxicity increases with increasing carbon chain length   (giesy et al 2010)  assuming this is the basis of utilizing read across information it may be worthwhile to state this assumption within the context of utilizing read across  on the other hand data cited in paragraph 86 from lou et al 2013 indicate effects were observed resulting from pfos exposure while no effects were observed from pfbs exposure  in paragraph 96 effects were noted by corsini et al 2012 in exposures to both pfos and pfbs  these two examples may help establish a framework to explain the use of read across information  where effects exists for both pfos and pfbs which can be viewed as boundary substances to pfhxs in terms of carbon chain length it may be reasonable to infer that a similar effect is elicited by pfhxs although assigning a median effect concentration may be challenging  other considerations can also include a statement when appropriate where a read across approach is even more limitative such as for ecotoxicity data due to sparse toxixity results and the species- gender- and chain length-dependency   furthermore in the absence of having results for both pfos and pfbs there is an absence of support for asserting that a similar effect would be elicited by pfhxs  in the examples provided earlier lou et al observe an effect from pfos exposure but none for pfbs  consequently assigning similar behavior to pfhxs is difficult to support  use of read across information by interpolating between similar substances is a useful and legitimate technique in risk assessment particularly when dealing with relatively data poor substances  by articulating a framework as to when and how read across information is used and citing data that falls within this framework would strengthen the risk profile for pfhxs,0

overarching comment on “read-across approach” to support the risk profile for pfhxs it is suggested that the risk profile would be strengthened by including the approach that has been adopted on how and when data on analogous substances are to be used  data from analogous substances are cited notably from pfos and pfbs   in the absence of an approach the readers are invited to apply their own interpretation which may vary creating debate as to the relevance and applicability of the read across information presented  for instance in paragraph 86 it is stated that available studies comparing toxic effects of pfbs and pfos in aquatic organisms indicate that toxicity increases with increasing carbon chain length   (giesy et al 2010)  assuming this is the basis of utilizing read across information it may be worthwhile to state this assumption within the context of utilizing read across  on the other hand data cited in paragraph 86 from lou et al 2013 indicate effects were observed resulting from pfos exposure while no effects were observed from pfbs exposure  in paragraph 96 effects were noted by corsini et al 2012 in exposures to both pfos and pfbs  these two examples may help establish a framework to explain the use of read across information  where effects exists for both pfos and pfbs which can be viewed as boundary substances to pfhxs in terms of carbon chain length it may be reasonable to infer that a similar effect is elicited by pfhxs although assigning a median effect concentration may be challenging  other considerations can also include a statement when appropriate where a read across approach is even more limitative such as for ecotoxicity data due to sparse toxixity results and the species- gender- and chain length-dependency   furthermore in the absence of having results for both pfos and pfbs there is an absence of support for asserting that a similar effect would be elicited by pfhxs  in the examples provided earlier lou et al observe an effect from pfos exposure but none for pfbs  consequently assigning similar behavior to pfhxs is difficult to support  use of read across information by interpolating between similar substances is a useful and legitimate technique in risk assessment particularly when dealing with relatively data poor substances  by articulating a framework as to when and how read across information is used and citing data that falls within this framework would strengthen the risk profile for pfhxs,0

overarching comment on “read-across approach” to support the risk profile for pfhxs it is suggested that the risk profile would be strengthened by including the approach that has been adopted on how and when data on analogous substances are to be used  data from analogous substances are cited notably from pfos and pfbs   in the absence of an approach the readers are invited to apply their own interpretation which may vary creating debate as to the relevance and applicability of the read across information presented  for instance in paragraph 86 it is stated that available studies comparing toxic effects of pfbs and pfos in aquatic organisms indicate that toxicity increases with increasing carbon chain length   (giesy et al 2010)  assuming this is the basis of utilizing read across information it may be worthwhile to state this assumption within the context of utilizing read across  on the other hand data cited in paragraph 86 from lou et al 2013 indicate effects were observed resulting from pfos exposure while no effects were observed from pfbs exposure  in paragraph 96 effects were noted by corsini et al 2012 in exposures to both pfos and pfbs  these two examples may help establish a framework to explain the use of read across information  where effects exists for both pfos and pfbs which can be viewed as boundary substances to pfhxs in terms of carbon chain length it may be reasonable to infer that a similar effect is elicited by pfhxs although assigning a median effect concentration may be challenging  other considerations can also include a statement when appropriate where a read across approach is even more limitative such as for ecotoxicity data due to sparse toxixity results and the species- gender- and chain length-dependency   furthermore in the absence of having results for both pfos and pfbs there is an absence of support for asserting that a similar effect would be elicited by pfhxs  in the examples provided earlier lou et al observe an effect from pfos exposure but none for pfbs  consequently assigning similar behavior to pfhxs is difficult to support  use of read across information by interpolating between similar substances is a useful and legitimate technique in risk assessment particularly when dealing with relatively data poor substances  by articulating a framework as to when and how read across information is used and citing data that falls within this framework would strengthen the risk profile for pfhxs,0

incorrect not comparing like-with-like when the placebo group rates for similar (although not identical) outcomes in these trials are considered (including in particular for meteor) then they range from only about 2 to about 14 (based on adverse events leading to discontinuation) which is about a 7-fold (not 30-fold) difference however as noted above the definitions used in the different trials differ and so too do the types of patient and follow-up duration which may lead to differences in rates between trials,1

consider that this may create quite a burden on the commission if this is undertaken annually and particularly if the risk-based approach is not clearly defined  issf considers that it is important to not only continue to prioritize the obligations to be assessed but to also clarify why these obligations have been selectedissf reiterates its previous suggestion to develop criteria that identifies the highest priority cmms based on a risk assessment of the impact of non-compliance on meeting the wcpf convention objectives for example cmms with catch or effort limits non-compliance with such cmms would undermine the conservation and management of the resource which would have impacts on economic development opportunities and food security for coastal states cmms with closed areas or prohibitions (eg fad temporal/spatial closures at-sea transshipment for purse seine vessels shark finning retention of certain shark species or whale shark encirclement) ccms with specific procedures that are pre-requisites to allowing a particular activity (ie at-sea transshipment for longline troll and other vessels) ccms or decisions for data reporting both for target and non-target species including observer coverage requirements non-compliance with such cmms would undermine the ability of the commission to conduct stock assessments or other analyses which would increase uncertainties in the scientific advice available to the commission and cmms that have provisions where differing interpretations are impacting effective implementation of the cmm itself and therefore could impact the conservation and management of the stockfinally the current cms cmm requires that successive instances of non-compliance triggers the escalation of the response to the non-compliance but it is not clear how these obligations would trigger this response if the obligation was assessed only every two or three years moreover the delayed assessment provides a protracted period during which the non-compliance could continue one approach may be that for lower prioritized obligations that are only assessed periodically any non- compliance is automatically escalated to the second-tier response and re-assessed for that ccm the following year,0

in my opinion scout cars should run with 4 wheels (versus 3  guide pin) beyond tradition the rationale for 4 wheels is that it ensures the car will stay on the track and not slide off the center rail and collide with another car of course pin guides would address this but then we would need some rules and guidelines around something that isn’t even provided in the kit requiring the 4 wheels is easier,1

note to drafters many contracts have an esclation factor set to the cpi-u for either the initial term or for renewal terms best practice is to fix the rates for each term but in some circumstances this is the best way to account for growth if this is used make sure that you are specific which cpi-u you are using (eg for the whole us for the denver-boulder-greeley area etc…) because sometimes the change in cpi for those different areas can vary significantly for the same year also the cpi is an indexed number and so any price modification should be clear that it is equal to the “annual percent change in the cpi-u” and not written as being equal to the cpi-u,0

incorrect not comparing like-with-like when the placebo group rates for similar (although not identical) outcomes in these trials are considered (including in particular for meteor) then they range from only about 2 to about 14 (based on adverse events leading to discontinuation) which is about a 7-fold (not 30-fold) difference however as noted above the definitions used in the different trials differ and so too do the types of patient and follow-up duration which may lead to differences in rates between trials,0

overarching comment on “read-across approach” to support the risk profile for pfhxs it is suggested that the risk profile would be strengthened by including the approach that has been adopted on how and when data on analogous substances are to be used  data from analogous substances are cited notably from pfos and pfbs   in the absence of an approach the readers are invited to apply their own interpretation which may vary creating debate as to the relevance and applicability of the read across information presented  for instance in paragraph 86 it is stated that available studies comparing toxic effects of pfbs and pfos in aquatic organisms indicate that toxicity increases with increasing carbon chain length   (giesy et al 2010)  assuming this is the basis of utilizing read across information it may be worthwhile to state this assumption within the context of utilizing read across  on the other hand data cited in paragraph 86 from lou et al 2013 indicate effects were observed resulting from pfos exposure while no effects were observed from pfbs exposure  in paragraph 96 effects were noted by corsini et al 2012 in exposures to both pfos and pfbs  these two examples may help establish a framework to explain the use of read across information  where effects exists for both pfos and pfbs which can be viewed as boundary substances to pfhxs in terms of carbon chain length it may be reasonable to infer that a similar effect is elicited by pfhxs although assigning a median effect concentration may be challenging  other considerations can also include a statement when appropriate where a read across approach is even more limitative such as for ecotoxicity data due to sparse toxixity results and the species- gender- and chain length-dependency   furthermore in the absence of having results for both pfos and pfbs there is an absence of support for asserting that a similar effect would be elicited by pfhxs  in the examples provided earlier lou et al observe an effect from pfos exposure but none for pfbs  consequently assigning similar behavior to pfhxs is difficult to support  use of read across information by interpolating between similar substances is a useful and legitimate technique in risk assessment particularly when dealing with relatively data poor substances  by articulating a framework as to when and how read across information is used and citing data that falls within this framework would strengthen the risk profile for pfhxs,0

overarching comment on “read-across approach” to support the risk profile for pfhxs it is suggested that the risk profile would be strengthened by including the approach that has been adopted on how and when data on analogous substances are to be used  data from analogous substances are cited notably from pfos and pfbs   in the absence of an approach the readers are invited to apply their own interpretation which may vary creating debate as to the relevance and applicability of the read across information presented  for instance in paragraph 86 it is stated that available studies comparing toxic effects of pfbs and pfos in aquatic organisms indicate that toxicity increases with increasing carbon chain length   (giesy et al 2010)  assuming this is the basis of utilizing read across information it may be worthwhile to state this assumption within the context of utilizing read across  on the other hand data cited in paragraph 86 from lou et al 2013 indicate effects were observed resulting from pfos exposure while no effects were observed from pfbs exposure  in paragraph 96 effects were noted by corsini et al 2012 in exposures to both pfos and pfbs  these two examples may help establish a framework to explain the use of read across information  where effects exists for both pfos and pfbs which can be viewed as boundary substances to pfhxs in terms of carbon chain length it may be reasonable to infer that a similar effect is elicited by pfhxs although assigning a median effect concentration may be challenging  other considerations can also include a statement when appropriate where a read across approach is even more limitative such as for ecotoxicity data due to sparse toxixity results and the species- gender- and chain length-dependency   furthermore in the absence of having results for both pfos and pfbs there is an absence of support for asserting that a similar effect would be elicited by pfhxs  in the examples provided earlier lou et al observe an effect from pfos exposure but none for pfbs  consequently assigning similar behavior to pfhxs is difficult to support  use of read across information by interpolating between similar substances is a useful and legitimate technique in risk assessment particularly when dealing with relatively data poor substances  by articulating a framework as to when and how read across information is used and citing data that falls within this framework would strengthen the risk profile for pfhxs,0

overarching comment on “read-across approach” to support the risk profile for pfhxs it is suggested that the risk profile would be strengthened by including the approach that has been adopted on how and when data on analogous substances are to be used  data from analogous substances are cited notably from pfos and pfbs   in the absence of an approach the readers are invited to apply their own interpretation which may vary creating debate as to the relevance and applicability of the read across information presented  for instance in paragraph 86 it is stated that available studies comparing toxic effects of pfbs and pfos in aquatic organisms indicate that toxicity increases with increasing carbon chain length   (giesy et al 2010)  assuming this is the basis of utilizing read across information it may be worthwhile to state this assumption within the context of utilizing read across  on the other hand data cited in paragraph 86 from lou et al 2013 indicate effects were observed resulting from pfos exposure while no effects were observed from pfbs exposure  in paragraph 96 effects were noted by corsini et al 2012 in exposures to both pfos and pfbs  these two examples may help establish a framework to explain the use of read across information  where effects exists for both pfos and pfbs which can be viewed as boundary substances to pfhxs in terms of carbon chain length it may be reasonable to infer that a similar effect is elicited by pfhxs although assigning a median effect concentration may be challenging  other considerations can also include a statement when appropriate where a read across approach is even more limitative such as for ecotoxicity data due to sparse toxixity results and the species- gender- and chain length-dependency   furthermore in the absence of having results for both pfos and pfbs there is an absence of support for asserting that a similar effect would be elicited by pfhxs  in the examples provided earlier lou et al observe an effect from pfos exposure but none for pfbs  consequently assigning similar behavior to pfhxs is difficult to support  use of read across information by interpolating between similar substances is a useful and legitimate technique in risk assessment particularly when dealing with relatively data poor substances  by articulating a framework as to when and how read across information is used and citing data that falls within this framework would strengthen the risk profile for pfhxs,0

consider that this may create quite a burden on the commission if this is undertaken annually and particularly if the risk-based approach is not clearly defined  issf considers that it is important to not only continue to prioritize the obligations to be assessed but to also clarify why these obligations have been selectedissf reiterates its previous suggestion to develop criteria that identifies the highest priority cmms based on a risk assessment of the impact of non-compliance on meeting the wcpf convention objectives for example cmms with catch or effort limits non-compliance with such cmms would undermine the conservation and management of the resource which would have impacts on economic development opportunities and food security for coastal states cmms with closed areas or prohibitions (eg fad temporal/spatial closures at-sea transshipment for purse seine vessels shark finning retention of certain shark species or whale shark encirclement) ccms with specific procedures that are pre-requisites to allowing a particular activity (ie at-sea transshipment for longline troll and other vessels) ccms or decisions for data reporting both for target and non-target species including observer coverage requirements non-compliance with such cmms would undermine the ability of the commission to conduct stock assessments or other analyses which would increase uncertainties in the scientific advice available to the commission and cmms that have provisions where differing interpretations are impacting effective implementation of the cmm itself and therefore could impact the conservation and management of the stockfinally the current cms cmm requires that successive instances of non-compliance triggers the escalation of the response to the non-compliance but it is not clear how these obligations would trigger this response if the obligation was assessed only every two or three years moreover the delayed assessment provides a protracted period during which the non-compliance could continue one approach may be that for lower prioritized obligations that are only assessed periodically any non- compliance is automatically escalated to the second-tier response and re-assessed for that ccm the following year,0

consider that this may create quite a burden on the commission if this is undertaken annually and particularly if the risk-based approach is not clearly defined  issf considers that it is important to not only continue to prioritize the obligations to be assessed but to also clarify why these obligations have been selectedissf reiterates its previous suggestion to develop criteria that identifies the highest priority cmms based on a risk assessment of the impact of non-compliance on meeting the wcpf convention objectives for example cmms with catch or effort limits non-compliance with such cmms would undermine the conservation and management of the resource which would have impacts on economic development opportunities and food security for coastal states cmms with closed areas or prohibitions (eg fad temporal/spatial closures at-sea transshipment for purse seine vessels shark finning retention of certain shark species or whale shark encirclement) ccms with specific procedures that are pre-requisites to allowing a particular activity (ie at-sea transshipment for longline troll and other vessels) ccms or decisions for data reporting both for target and non-target species including observer coverage requirements non-compliance with such cmms would undermine the ability of the commission to conduct stock assessments or other analyses which would increase uncertainties in the scientific advice available to the commission and cmms that have provisions where differing interpretations are impacting effective implementation of the cmm itself and therefore could impact the conservation and management of the stockfinally the current cms cmm requires that successive instances of non-compliance triggers the escalation of the response to the non-compliance but it is not clear how these obligations would trigger this response if the obligation was assessed only every two or three years moreover the delayed assessment provides a protracted period during which the non-compliance could continue one approach may be that for lower prioritized obligations that are only assessed periodically any non- compliance is automatically escalated to the second-tier response and re-assessed for that ccm the following year,1

the research protocol must contain an introductory section explaining why the research is to be carried out the scientific and social relevance of the project should be indicated with references to peer reviewed papers published in scientific journals (an overview of the references can be given in chapter 14) the results of any pre-clinical studies with potential clinical significance and of any clinical trials or studies relevant to the proposed research should be summarized convincing arguments should be given that there is not sufficient knowledge available to explain the problem or for the need to test what is known it should be clearly stated which new information this study may add to what we already know  this section should also explain why the research needs to be conducted with the selected population this is particularly important where minors or incapacitated adults are to be used as subjects,0

agree - issf considers that the cms is a tool for assessing ccm implementation of its obligations the cms should provide a mechanism to assess the implementation and enforcement of their obligations agreed through the adoption of cmms  assessing and sanctioning vessel-level non-compliance for serious infringements is more appropriately taken up through other mechanisms eg the iuu vessel listing procedures  that’s said it is important to note that non-compliance of aggregated vessel level non-compliance may be indicative of poor implementation or enforcement by the ccm and as such it is important that the cms considers1 provide information to the commission regarding its investigation or actions taken as a flag state and2 how the cms and iuu vessel list can work cohesively to ensure both ccm implementation and enforcement together with effective management of iuu fishing for example individual vessel level non-compliance identified through the cms could be taken up under as a sub-agenda of the iuu listing agenda item,0

consider that this may create quite a burden on the commission if this is undertaken annually and particularly if the risk-based approach is not clearly defined  issf considers that it is important to not only continue to prioritize the obligations to be assessed but to also clarify why these obligations have been selectedissf reiterates its previous suggestion to develop criteria that identifies the highest priority cmms based on a risk assessment of the impact of non-compliance on meeting the wcpf convention objectives for example cmms with catch or effort limits non-compliance with such cmms would undermine the conservation and management of the resource which would have impacts on economic development opportunities and food security for coastal states cmms with closed areas or prohibitions (eg fad temporal/spatial closures at-sea transshipment for purse seine vessels shark finning retention of certain shark species or whale shark encirclement) ccms with specific procedures that are pre-requisites to allowing a particular activity (ie at-sea transshipment for longline troll and other vessels) ccms or decisions for data reporting both for target and non-target species including observer coverage requirements non-compliance with such cmms would undermine the ability of the commission to conduct stock assessments or other analyses which would increase uncertainties in the scientific advice available to the commission and cmms that have provisions where differing interpretations are impacting effective implementation of the cmm itself and therefore could impact the conservation and management of the stockfinally the current cms cmm requires that successive instances of non-compliance triggers the escalation of the response to the non-compliance but it is not clear how these obligations would trigger this response if the obligation was assessed only every two or three years moreover the delayed assessment provides a protracted period during which the non-compliance could continue one approach may be that for lower prioritized obligations that are only assessed periodically any non- compliance is automatically escalated to the second-tier response and re-assessed for that ccm the following year,0

the number of subjects required for the study should be justified the number of subjects should always be large enough to provide a reliable answer to questions addressed also the size of detectable differences should be of clinical relevancethe number of subjects is usually determined by the primary objective of the trial if the sample size is determined on some other basis then this should be made clear and justified there are many formulas to calculate the size of the study population it should be clear which method is used and the reasons why this method has been chosen in case of multiple primary objectives eg evaluation of multiple endpoints each objective should have its own power calculation and in each of these the multiplicity corrected alpha if needed should be taken into accountalso the calculation itself should be given with a predefined p-value (usually 5) and power the power of the study is the probability that the study will have a significant (positive) result  provided a positive effect exists ask advice from a statistician to help you with this matter,0

overarching comment on “read-across approach” to support the risk profile for pfhxs it is suggested that the risk profile would be strengthened by including the approach that has been adopted on how and when data on analogous substances are to be used  data from analogous substances are cited notably from pfos and pfbs   in the absence of an approach the readers are invited to apply their own interpretation which may vary creating debate as to the relevance and applicability of the read across information presented  for instance in paragraph 86 it is stated that available studies comparing toxic effects of pfbs and pfos in aquatic organisms indicate that toxicity increases with increasing carbon chain length   (giesy et al 2010)  assuming this is the basis of utilizing read across information it may be worthwhile to state this assumption within the context of utilizing read across  on the other hand data cited in paragraph 86 from lou et al 2013 indicate effects were observed resulting from pfos exposure while no effects were observed from pfbs exposure  in paragraph 96 effects were noted by corsini et al 2012 in exposures to both pfos and pfbs  these two examples may help establish a framework to explain the use of read across information  where effects exists for both pfos and pfbs which can be viewed as boundary substances to pfhxs in terms of carbon chain length it may be reasonable to infer that a similar effect is elicited by pfhxs although assigning a median effect concentration may be challenging  other considerations can also include a statement when appropriate where a read across approach is even more limitative such as for ecotoxicity data due to sparse toxixity results and the species- gender- and chain length-dependency   furthermore in the absence of having results for both pfos and pfbs there is an absence of support for asserting that a similar effect would be elicited by pfhxs  in the examples provided earlier lou et al observe an effect from pfos exposure but none for pfbs  consequently assigning similar behavior to pfhxs is difficult to support  use of read across information by interpolating between similar substances is a useful and legitimate technique in risk assessment particularly when dealing with relatively data poor substances  by articulating a framework as to when and how read across information is used and citing data that falls within this framework would strengthen the risk profile for pfhxs,0

this language as drafted would appear to apply to a foreign corporation filing an 1120f and if so it would include only the domestic income of that corporation—which does not seem to be the intent if the group files on a worldwide basis then it would need to be worldwide income of the corporation but the group may intend or not that only domestic income under the water’s edge approach is required to be included (if so this would appear to change what the original model would require),0

overarching comment on “read-across approach” to support the risk profile for pfhxs it is suggested that the risk profile would be strengthened by including the approach that has been adopted on how and when data on analogous substances are to be used  data from analogous substances are cited notably from pfos and pfbs   in the absence of an approach the readers are invited to apply their own interpretation which may vary creating debate as to the relevance and applicability of the read across information presented  for instance in paragraph 86 it is stated that available studies comparing toxic effects of pfbs and pfos in aquatic organisms indicate that toxicity increases with increasing carbon chain length   (giesy et al 2010)  assuming this is the basis of utilizing read across information it may be worthwhile to state this assumption within the context of utilizing read across  on the other hand data cited in paragraph 86 from lou et al 2013 indicate effects were observed resulting from pfos exposure while no effects were observed from pfbs exposure  in paragraph 96 effects were noted by corsini et al 2012 in exposures to both pfos and pfbs  these two examples may help establish a framework to explain the use of read across information  where effects exists for both pfos and pfbs which can be viewed as boundary substances to pfhxs in terms of carbon chain length it may be reasonable to infer that a similar effect is elicited by pfhxs although assigning a median effect concentration may be challenging  other considerations can also include a statement when appropriate where a read across approach is even more limitative such as for ecotoxicity data due to sparse toxixity results and the species- gender- and chain length-dependency   furthermore in the absence of having results for both pfos and pfbs there is an absence of support for asserting that a similar effect would be elicited by pfhxs  in the examples provided earlier lou et al observe an effect from pfos exposure but none for pfbs  consequently assigning similar behavior to pfhxs is difficult to support  use of read across information by interpolating between similar substances is a useful and legitimate technique in risk assessment particularly when dealing with relatively data poor substances  by articulating a framework as to when and how read across information is used and citing data that falls within this framework would strengthen the risk profile for pfhxs,0
